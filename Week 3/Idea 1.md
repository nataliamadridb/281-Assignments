# Motivation

Understanding how monetary policy affects firm investment is critical for macroeconomic policy design—particularly during recessions, when financing constraints become most binding. However, not all firms respond equally to changes in interest rates. During downturns, many firms face heightened default risk and lose access to credit on favorable terms. In these moments, **heterogeneous firm responses** become central: some firms can borrow and invest, while others are pushed toward default, restructuring, or asset liquidation.

Ottonello and Winberry (2020) provide a widely used framework in which firms with stronger balance sheets—i.e., lower default risk—drive the aggregate investment response to monetary easing. However, their model imposes a **strict dividend non-negativity constraint**, effectively ruling out equity issuance as a margin of adjustment. This assumption may severely limit the framework’s realism in crisis scenarios.

In practice, many firms issue equity *precisely* when default risk increases. For instance, during the 2020 COVID-19 crisis and the 2022 tightening cycle, firms like Delta Airlines, Carnival, and AMC raised billions via emergency equity offerings to shore up their balance sheets. At the same time, the corporate bond market—particularly for high-yield issuers—surged as firms responded to the Fed’s emergency credit facilities (Gilchrist et al., 2022; Acharya et al., 2022). These episodes highlight the importance of **market-based finance** when traditional bank credit breaks down.

By excluding equity issuance and bond financing, the Ottonello-Winberry model may **understate the investment responsiveness of distressed but systemically important firms**. This motivates my proposed extension of their framework to endogenize equity issuance and incorporate access to bond markets.

# Research Question

**How does access to equity and bond markets alter firm investment responses to monetary policy shocks, especially for high-risk firms near default?**

# Contribution

This project extends the Ottonello & Winberry (2020) heterogeneous firm model to allow:

1. **Endogenous equity issuance**, particularly when firms approach borrowing constraints or default, subject to issuance costs (e.g., dilution, fixed costs).
2. **A corporate bond market**, as an alternative external financing margin, featuring firm-specific risk premiums and default probabilities.

These additions allow me to:

- Assess whether equity issuance mitigates financial frictions and preserves investment capacity in distressed firms.
- Examine how the presence of bond markets reallocates the investment response across firms.
- Provide a theoretical framework that better matches observed firm behavior during recent financial and monetary shocks.

# Model Extension (Theoretical)

I extend the Ottonello-Winberry model along two main dimensions:

### 1. Relaxing the dividend constraint

Firms can now issue equity
