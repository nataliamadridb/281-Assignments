## Identification Strategy

I will follow the identification strategy from Ottonello & Winberry (2020) to study whether firms with higher exposure to physical climate risk respond differently to monetary policy shocks in terms of their investment behavior.

<pre> ŒîlogK_{i,t+1} = Œ±·µ¢ + Œ≥‚Çú + Œ≤‚ÇÅ(MPShock‚Çú √ó (ClimateRisk·µ¢ - ùîº[ClimateRisk·µ¢])) + Œ≤‚ÇÇ X_{i,t} + Œµ_{i,t+1} </pre>

### Variable Definitions:

- $\Delta \log K_{i,t+1}$: Log change in firm $i$'s capital stock (e.g., investment growth)  
- $\alpha_i$: Firm fixed effects  
- $\gamma_t$: Time fixed effects  
- $\text{ClimateRisk}_i$: Firm-specific measure of physical climate risk 
- $\text{MPShock}_t$: Monetary policy shock at time $t$ (high-frequency identified)  
- $\mathbf{X}_{it}$: Vector of time-varying firm-level controls (e.g., size, leverage, liquidity)  
- $\varepsilon_{it}$: Error term
- 

### Key Elements

- Monetary policy shocks $\text{MPShock}_t$ are identified using high-frequency event-study methods, ensuring they are exogenous to individual firm decisions and not driven by firm-specific or sector-specific conditions.
- The regression includes:
  - **Firm fixed effects** (`Œ±_i`) to control for time-invariant unobserved firm characteristics
  - **Time fixed effects** (`Œ≥_t`) to absorb aggregate shocks and policy trends
  - Additional controls: firm size, leverage, liquidity, industry √ó year fixed effects

### Identification Assumptions (economic meaning as suggested)

1. **Exogeneity of Monetary Policy Shocks**  
   Monetary shocks must be unanticipated and orthogonal to firm-specific shocks. For example, the Fed should not be reacting directly to climate-related conditions in certain sectors or regions when setting interest rates.

2. **No Simultaneous Climate Events Biasing Estimates**  
   The estimated effect should not be driven by natural disasters coinciding with monetary shocks (e.g., hurricanes occurring in the same quarter as a rate cut). These events are either excluded or controlled for using disaster indicators.

3. **Climate Risk Is Not a Proxy for Other Frictions**  
   The climate risk variable should not simply capture other sources of investment sluggishness (e.g., firm size or capital intensity). The inclusion of rich firm-level controls mitigates this risk.

4. **Parallel Trends**  
   In the absence of monetary policy shocks, firms with high and low climate risk would have followed similar investment trends ‚Äî this is addressed by firm and time fixed effects.

### Interpretation
Under these assumptions, the coefficient **Œ≤‚ÇÅ** captures the differential effect of a monetary policy shock (*MPShock‚Çú*) on firm investment (Œîlog‚ÄØK·µ¢,‚Çú‚Çä‚ÇÅ) depending on how a firm's climate risk deviates from the average (i.e., the within-period variation in climate risk exposure).

- If **Œ≤‚ÇÅ < 0**: Firms more exposed to climate risk than average reduce investment more (or increase it less) in response to an accommodative monetary policy shock (e.g., a rate cut).

- If **Œ≤‚ÇÅ > 0**: These firms respond more strongly (i.e., increase investment more) to the shock than less-exposed firms.

## Data  
- **Firm financials**: Compustat (investment, leverage, size). Available in the data folder.
- **Monetary policy shocks**: High-frequency monetary shocks (I was planning to use Romer Romer but they are available until 2007). 
- **Physical climate risk**: I uploaded some proxies from Bloomberg.
